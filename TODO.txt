//In actual program

Give cooldown for enemy bullets
 make bullets, fire rate faster
Add new enemy types to make use of the inheritance. Such as a laser cannon one (Could either drop a stationary laser cannon or moving one (with the enemy) which has a low chance of spawning and gives a warning highlight then does damage to all blocks and two hearts from the player)
Add different patterns for aliens to change level variety
Add quicker less damage bullets along with current


Get value from database and merge sort them when a button is pressed - by default no sorting is done and is just in the order of the userID
Add leaderboard - buttons along the top and for usernames in order to see specific users games or to sort by a certain value ascending or descending

//In database

Reset player and game IDs using ALTER SEQUENCE idName RESTART WITH 0;



//In writeup

Write up why I decided to make variables/methods as private in technical solution section
In techincal, show examples of high level techniques, write why you have used them

make project summary better
Explanation of why doing game, end user, how is it different to others. Add images of other games for references etc
Questions for the survey lead into objectives. Changes made based off of the survey + your own results and end user as well as any constraints/limitations.

Move human computer interaction into modelling section. Shows how menus will look. What I wanted it to look like
Why using different colour schemes under the modelling section.

Need ERD diagram
Top down diagram (heirarchy chart) decompose it

Class diagrams with relationships (inheritance, polymorphism etc) For polymorphism I could use when displaying data from the leaderboard if the user only wants a specific user

Flow charts for algorithms
Put code under an appendix and point it out. Mention where you have used certain techniques. Show where classes are started

Mention how players found it hard to know how long the reload time is so reload bar was implemented
