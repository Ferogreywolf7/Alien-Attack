//In actual program

Give cooldown for enemy bullets
 make bullets, fire rate faster
Add new enemy types to make use of the inheritance. Such as a laser cannon one (Could either drop a stationary laser cannon or moving one (with the enemy) which has a low chance of spawning and gives a warning highlight then does damage to all blocks and two hearts from the player)
Add different patterns for aliens to change level variety
Add quicker less damage bullets along with current


Get value from database and merge sort them when a button is pressed - by default no sorting is done and is just in the order of the userID
Add leaderboard - buttons along the top and for usernames in order to see specific users games or to sort by a certain value ascending or descending

In the entering of text method in the ui class, make it so if the text entered is a letter (check using regex), pass to a seperate method where it gets the lowercase letter, then do a .upper

//In database

Reset player and game IDs using ALTER SEQUENCE idName RESTART WITH 0;

Copy the new function to update it in the database
//In writeup

Write up why I decided to make variables/methods as private in technical solution section
In techincal, show examples of high level techniques, write why you have used them

make project summary better
Explanation of why doing game, end user, how is it different to others. Add images of other games for references etc
Questions for the survey lead into objectives. Changes made based off of the survey + your own results and end user as well as any constraints/limitations.



Top down diagram (hierarchy chart) decompose it

Class diagrams with relationships (inheritance, polymorphism etc) For polymorphism I could use when displaying data from the leaderboard if the user only wants a specific user

Flow charts for algorithms


Talk about how I got feedback from players for a prototype version and implemented it in the testing section - Mention how players found it hard to know how long the reload time is so reload bar was implemented

Move gameplay flow chart into design and update

Using documents from year 12 fpcloud:

Analysis:
Identify end users
Introductory paragraph to the project: Talk about what the game is, what you want to achieve, how it is working
Summaries needs of end user/project
Describe any constrainst/limitations
Need ERD diagram of existing systems, screenshots of existing games in modelling
Move human computer interaction into modelling section. Shows how menus will look. What I wanted it to look like
Why using different colour schemes under the modelling section.
Better objectives
Talk about what software using and why

Design:
ERD
Interface design
Algorithms
Data flow diagram (not an algorithm)
Normalisation
Hardware selection (what hardware is it being used on)
Security and integrity of data 


Technical solution: (Worth most marks)
commenting code to explain full method and areas broken down
Evidence of user interface which is annotated to show what specific areas are
Put code under an appendix and point it out as examples. Show where classes are started in the appendix. 
Mention where you have used certain techniques and relate to specific index as well as screenshot. 
Evidence of variables
Evidence of tables created

Change regular records into arrays of records for more marks
Add create table into a seperate program which connects to the database 

Talk about using stopwatch for checking delays and other things

Add constants where certain variables aren't changed
Remove global variables where possible
Mention how with the keyboard inputs certain symbols aren't allowed due to not existing in the font properly
Mention that file paths are parameterised
Mention all defensive programming


Testing:
Create an unlisted youtube video where everything is shown testing
Reference timing in youtube video to explain how objectives are completed
